 - Developed on Ben Eater's [8-bit breadboard Computer](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU)to be a 16-bit
   computer with more functionality in the ALU and CPU core.
 - Designed the ALU and added MUL and DIV circuit
 - Designed the CPU on Proteus and simulate its functionalities.
 - Implemented the hardware circuit of the RAM unit and Accumulator register.
